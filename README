OpenSMTPD spam trap support
===========================

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! DEPRECATE WARNING !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Due to changes made in opensmtpd since version 6.0.3, filter are not
available any more, in favor of new filter daemon (not yet productive).
I will adapt these filter to the new daemon as soon as the daemon become
ready, in the meanwhile, if you want to still using this filter just
downgrade to version 6.0.2.


This extra filter allow you to create a spam tram in OpenSMTPD, using DNSBL,
greylisting and SPF check all-in-one.

Requires:
  libspf2
  libdb

Compile:
  make

Install:
  cp filter-spam to the proper library dir of opensmtpd

Run:
  As any other filter.
